### About Me

As a Computer Science student at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, I have gained a strong foundation in programming and problem-solving. My coursework in data structures, algorithms, computer organization, and software engineering has provided me with hands-on experience, allowing me to apply my skills to real-world problems. I am proficient in C++, Python, Java, LUA, C#, Microsoft Office, and Git, and always strive to learn more.

In addition to my studies, I have worked on several personal programming projects. One of my most successful projects is RaidVoice, a Python program that assists players of Escape from Tarkov in determining the current market price of in-game items. This program utilizes text-to-speech technology, which makes it easier for users to retrieve pricing information quickly.

Another project I developed is LINKBot, a versatile Discord bot written in Python. This bot has a wide range of capabilities, including voice generation, image recognition, Tarkov item prices, weather information, dice and coin flipping, and stock prices. LINKBot is user-friendly and has added value to many Discord communities.

I also developed a C++ program called Hockey Statistics, which tackles data manipulation and storage utilizing a binary search tree. This program is capable of storing, organizing, and computing player data. It efficiently handles input, which is processed into an easy-to-read output and copied to a file, making it easy for the user to read their data.

I am seeking an internship that will allow me to utilize my skills and knowledge to solve complex problems. As a hardworking and enthusiastic individual, I am eager to learn and grow in a professional environment. I am currently pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science with a 3.2 GPA and have been on the Dean's List in Fall 2021.
