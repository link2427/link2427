### About Me

I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, expected to graduate in December 2024. My academic journey, combined with hands-on experience from internships and personal projects, has sharpened my skills in software development, particularly in Python, C++, Java, and Swift. 

I've had the opportunity to contribute to a range of projects, from designing satellite simulation tools for the U.S. Navy to creating mobile apps and machine learning models. My work reflects a passion for solving real-world problems and an eagerness to push the boundaries of what technology can do.

### Personal Projects

**[Cosmotrak](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cosmotrak-satellite-tracker/id6557033963) (August 2024)**  
An offline-capable iOS app for satellite tracking with real-time 3D visualization, live pass alerts, and weather integration. I used Cesium and TLE data to power the app, with data delivery optimized via Cloudflare and AWS S3.

**[Aeroscape](https://github.com/link2427/Aeroscape) (April 2023)**  
A Java-based, object-oriented tile game featuring advanced gameplay mechanics such as material collection and placeable structures. I focused on creating a seamless user experience and optimized performance with render culling.

**[RaidEyes](https://jacob-neel.com/projects/raideyes) (January 2024)**  
A machine learning model designed for Escape from Tarkov, determining real-time market prices of in-game items. Developed using transfer learning techniques on the YOLOv8 architecture, with a custom dataset comprising millions of images.
